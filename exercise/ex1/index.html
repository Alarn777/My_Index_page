        <b><i>A black hole</i></b> - region &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of space-time exhibiting such strong gravitational
        <br>effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation
        <br>such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general
        <br>relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform
        <br>space-time to form a black hole. The boundary of the region
        <br>from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon.
        <br>Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and
        <br>circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features
        <br>appear to be observed. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black
        <br>body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved
        <br>space-time predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the
        <br>same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to
        <br>its mass. This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for
        <br>black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to observe.
